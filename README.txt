1. The Gaming Room wanted to create a browser game. Their goal was to reach the most amount of people possible. They wanted us to create a program that could be used on any browser regardless of the OS that was operating it. 

2. I think it is important to be able to make recommendations for your client. When going through the process you need to get as much information as possible and provide a recommendation for a tool that can be used to accomplish the end goal. I think I did a good job researching AWS and providing detailed information to the client on why it was the best option for their need.

3. Design documents help you break down the different parts of an end product you want to create. You need to do research on what it will take to complete your code. This gives you a better understanding of what you need. You start with a basic idea and each step of the way you narrow down the best option for producing your code. This ends up helping you focus and prepare yourself.

4. I would revise my work on the Development Requirements. I missed an entire column at this part and should of double checked that I filled out everything. I could of also done a better job researching the different operating systems. This would of also allowed me to do a better job on the Development Tools section. Looking back at this document those where my weakest points.

5. An unfortunate part about providing a product to people is that they always remember what was wrong. People are much more likely to write a review when they are unhappy with a product than happy with it. This means that focusing on the user's needs is very important when writing your code. Making the user experience smooth and optimal is extremely important. I would go over every part of the user side and make sure it is easy to use and understand. That way even if someone has no experience with your product they can pick it up and use it.

6. I like to tackle each individual part of my code one at a time. You need to make sure that ever piece of code can work on its own before you can try combining it with every thing else. If there are errors in a particular function you have designed that error will expand each time you try to add it to another piece of code. It is important to constantly test everything you create as you create it then test it again once you use it with something else. Testing your code at every step is probably one of the most important parts to programming.
